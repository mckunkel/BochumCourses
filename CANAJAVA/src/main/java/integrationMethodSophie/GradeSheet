I like the overall workflow
What I think could be improved on is commenting your codes.

I do not know if you plan on using Java later, but for the chance that you do, 
I would comment every method, primitive and constructor with some text
to help you remember later on what you were thinking at the time of writing 
that piece of code. But you're a python coder, so you "should" know this

I didnt see the second part of your homework, which was to construct a simple GUI. 
I am grading this ~1 school day (3 total days if weekends count). 
I looked at the merge request and also did not see a push for a GUI there. 
Therefore I have to conclude that the GUI part of the homework was forgotten.

Grading: 

-0.5 for the missing GUI

Grade 0.5/1.0
