I like the methods being used here, especially the Functions, Inheritances and overall workflow
What I think could be improved on is the Java syntax for methods and primitives  
and commenting your codes.
The Java syntax goes as follows...camelCasing
primitives that use 2 words to describe is 
first word lower case 
all other words get capital first letter, i.e.,

describeMe
iAmDescribed
same for methods

I do not know if you plan on using Java later, but for the chance that you do, 
I would comment every method, primitive and constructor with some text
to help you remember later on what you were thinking at the time of writing 
that piece of code.

Grading: 
-0.05 -- for not using Java convention
+0.05 -- for going outside of the box and using methods such as Function(R,T)
-0.025 -- Your output has not units!!

I would like to see buttons on your final GUI for a choice in 
which integration method to use.

Grade 0.975/1.0
